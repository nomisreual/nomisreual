# Hi there,

my name is Simon and welcome to my GitHub page. I am a trained economist who fell in love with coding.

I am mostly using Python, but Rust is my new adventure. Feel free to look around and see what I have been up to
(I also pinned my two latest projects).

I use *Nix* to set up my desktop (NixOS), my laptop (MacOS) and other tools:

- [Neovim](https://github.com/nomisreual/nixvim) using *Nixvim*.
- All my [configurations](https://github.com/nomisreual/nixdots) are managed with *Nix* and *Home Manager* (*Nix Darwin* on MacOS).
- I started creating [templates for *Nix* shells](https://github.com/nomisreual/nomisshells).
- Last but not least, a [*TMUX* session switcher](https://github.com/nomisreual/sessionizer) written in *Bash*script, easily packaged with *Nix*.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-antonius-lauer-14470b1b1/) as well.
