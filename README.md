# Hi there,

my name is Simon and welcome to my GitHub page. I am a trained economist who fell in love with coding.

I am mostly using Python, but Rust is my new adventure. Feel free to look around and see what I have been up to
(I also pinned my two latest projects).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-antonius-lauer-14470b1b1/) as well.
